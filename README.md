# AutoML-Python-Benchmark

Benchmarks of AutoML Frameworks for time series forecasting and anomaly detection.

These experiments are run with Python 3.8 and CUDA versions 11.2 and 11.7.

## CUDA Setup

To run this code, you will need to install CUDA for TensorFlow and PyTorch.

CUDA compatibilities for TensorFlow are listed [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows).

CUDA compatibilities for PyTorch are listed [here](https://pytorch.org/blog/deprecation-cuda-python-support/)

**NOTE: TensorFlow (GPU) on windows only supports CUDA <=11.2 while PyTorch (GPU) requires >=11.3. You will need multiple versions installed.**

The experiment results are based on CUDA 11.2 for TensorFlow and CUDA 11.7 for PyTorch which are officially recommended versions as of the 10th of March 2023.

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run experiments

Before running the code, datasets and repositories must be downloaded

```bash
sh ./shell/download_anomaly_datasets.sh # download anomaly detection datasets
sh ./shell/download_forecasting_datasets.sh # download forecasting datasets
sh ./shell/line_counts.sh # download repositories and count lines of code
```

After downloading repositories and datasets, you can run experiments with the following:

```bash
python run.py
```

## Tests and Linting

After installation and the download of repositories and datasets, you can run functional tests with:

```bash
pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests/functional_tests.py
```

Linting:

```bash
pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
python -m pylint src
```

Check if TensorFlow/PyTorch can access GPUs:

```bash
python ./tests/gpu_test.py
```

Profiling:

```bash
python -m cProfile -s time run.py > profile_verbose.txt
cat profile_verbose.txt | grep -e dataset_formatting.py -e forecasting.py -e util.py -e cumtime | grep -v "(<" > profile_summary.txt
```

Coverage report:

```bash
pip install -r ./tests/requirements.txt
coverage run -m pytest tests/functional_tests.py
coverage report --omit="env/*,venv/*,.env/*,.venv/*,*AppData*,*python37*,tests/*"
rm .coverage
```
